```
As a human living in a house,
So I can stay warm in winter,
I want a thermostat that starts at 20 degrees

As a cold human,
So I can be cosy,
I want to increase the temperature of my thermostat

As a warm human,
So I can cool down,
I want to decrease the temperature of my thermostat

As a human,
So that my pipes do not burst,
I want the temperature not to drop below 10 degrees

As an energy conscious homeowner
So I don't waste too much energy,
I want the maximum temperature to be 25 degrees when the power saving mode is on

As a warm human,
So I don't get too hot,
I want the maximum temperature to be be 32 degrees when the power saving mode is off

As a time-pressed homeowner,
So I can easily control my thermostat,
I want a reset button that resets the temperature to 20 degrees

As a energy conscious homeowner,
So I can see how much energy I'm using,
I want to see an output of my current energy usage
